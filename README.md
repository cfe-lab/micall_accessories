# This repo contains two scripts:
* simpleplot.py
* run_blast.py

## run_blast.py
This script is intended to simply create the `blast.csv` file required by many functions in micall.

## simpleplot.py
This script is intended to generate a figure with the HXB2 reference on top and multiple sequences aligned to it underneath. The sequences will be color-coded based on the result of hivseqinr.
